# FirstWork
This is first project on this account.

## Description
I propose making a website or an app.

## Topics
It could be an Blood Bank management system.

### Structure

#### REGISTER AS PATIENT
The user enters name, blood group, date & time of blood requirement. A PHP file checks the available blood table to see if there is enough blood. It also checks if the doctor doesnâ€™t have an existing appointment already at that date and time. If all checks are successful, the tables are updated and a new page comes up which asks for the patient details. On submitting this form, the patient table is updated. The appointment gets updated in appointment table
