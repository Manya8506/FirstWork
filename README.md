It could be an Blood Bank management system.

### Structure

#### REGISTER AS PATIENT
The user enters name, blood group, date & time of blood requirement. A PHP file checks the available blood table to see if there is enough blood. It also checks if the doctor doesnâ€™t have an existing appointment already at that date and time. If all checks are successful, the tables are updated and a new page comes up which asks for the patient details. On submitting this form, the patient table is updated. The appointment gets updated in appointment table

#### DOCTORS
The doctor enters login details which are checked in the doctor table. If entered correctly , a new page comes up showing the doctors previous , todays and upcoming appointments . These are three different pages . The doctor can sign out of his account . On clicking forgot password, the doctor id , new password ,security question and its answer is asked . The security question and answer is checked in the forgot table and the password is updated in the doctor table.
